# Old-businesses
Planning for the future and making sure that the business survives changing enviromental and market conditions is an integral part of the business. In this project, I investigated data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk , to answer questions such as :
- When were the business founded?
- Where were they located and to which industry do they belong to?
- What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?
